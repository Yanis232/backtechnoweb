            <p>Hello and welcome to L'Arbre Envie. My name is Rémi Mazoyer, I am 45 years old, and I am passionate about nature, manual work, and the sense of well-being one can feel in a forest, among trees, in your gardens, or on a tatami practicing Aikido. After a first career as an environmental engineer specializing in biological decontamination, I decided to switch to a more hands-on profession, closer to people and a healthier environment than the industrial sector, with the desire to help.

                With a multidisciplinary background in microbiology and process engineering, I had the opportunity to work as an engineer in the environmental sector. This journey allowed me to acquire solid expertise in soil management and industrial processes related to their decontamination. After the sudden end of a contract with a company, I felt a deep need to bounce back and find a field-based job, close to nature and human values, combining thought, physical effort, and creativity.

                In 2018, I obtained a Specialization Certificate in Tree Pruning and Care. This specialized training allowed me to learn the skills necessary to care for trees, maintain them with precision, and ensure their health. This career change, though radical at the time, remains an obvious choice for me even after eight years: it brings together my love for trees, gardens, and client interaction.

                Today, L'Arbre Envie and its team offer their skills, expertise, and equipment to meet your needs in the best possible way.

                My work is based on strong values: rigor, respect for life, and love for well-done work. My motto, which guides every one of my actions, is simple: "Either you do your job properly and with Passion, or you don't do it at all." Every project is an opportunity for me to apply this philosophy of life. If you are looking for a passionate, qualified, and attentive professional to care for your trees and gardens, do not hesitate to contact me. I would be delighted to assist you with your projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                See you soon,<br>
